In February 2025, I joined the group of Rico Zenklusen as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute for Operations Research at ETH Zurich. In 2024, I completed my PhD at the University of Bonn under the supervision of my PhD advisor, Jens Vygen. 

My main research interests lie in combinatorial optimization, with a particular focus on the design of approximation algorithms. In addition, I am interested in modeling real-world problems and developing efficient heuristics to address them.
