In February 2025, I joined the group of Rico Zenklusen as a Postdoctoral Researcher at ETH Zurich. My main research interest is the study of problems in combinatorial optimization. On one hand, I am interested in their computational hardness and in the design of approximation algorithms. On the other hand, I am interested in modelling real-world problems and implementing efficient algorithms that yield good solution on real-world instances.
